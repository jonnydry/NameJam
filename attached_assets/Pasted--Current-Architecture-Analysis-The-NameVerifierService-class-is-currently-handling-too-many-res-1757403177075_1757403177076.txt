## Current Architecture Analysis

The `NameVerifierService` class is currently handling too many responsibilities in a single large file (~700 lines). It manages:

- Easter egg detection for famous artists
- Multi-platform API verification (Spotify, iTunes, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Last.fm, MusicBrainz)
- Confidence calculation logic
- Similar name generation
- Famous names database management

## Major Issues Identified

1. __Giant monolithic method__: The `verifyName` method is 400+ lines long, making it difficult to test and maintain.

2. __Duplicated famous artist data__: The `easterEggArtists` and `famousArtists` arrays contain overlapping data with different handling logic.

3. __Hard-coded databases__: Famous names are buried in the code rather than being externalized.

4. __Complex, fragile verification flow__: The nested conditionals and multiple async operations make the logic error-prone.

5. __Inconsistent error handling__: Some errors are logged, others are swallowed silently, others fallback gracefully.

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Class Decomposition

Split the service into smaller, focused classes:

- `EasterEggService` - Handle special cases and trolling
- `VerificationOrchestrator` - Coordinate API calls and results
- `FamousNamesRepository` - Manage and query famous names database
- `NameSuggestionService` - Generate similar/alternative names
- `ConfidenceEvaluator` - Calculate verification confidence scores

### 2. Extract Configuration and Data

- Move all static arrays (artists, thematics, etc.) to external JSON configuration files
- Create a `MusicDatabases` class to manage historical/temporal data
- Externalize API rate limiting and retry configurations

### 3. Simplify Verification Flow

Replace the complex conditional tree with a:

- Clear verification pipeline (Easter Eggs → Fast Check → Deep Verification)
- Strategy pattern for different platforms (SpotifyStrategy, ItunesStrategy, etc.)
- Result aggregation service to combine and weight platform results

### 4. Improve Error Handling

- Standardize error handling across all API services
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for flaky APIs
- Better logging with structured JSON logs
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### 5. Performance Optimizations

- Add response caching for frequently checked names
- Implement deterministic name suggestions (remove random generation)
- Parallel API calls with proper timeout handling
- Request deduplication for concurrent similar queries

### 6. Testability Enhancements

- Extract dependencies to interfaces for better mocking
- Separate pure computation functions from I/O operations
- Add comprehensive unit test coverage
- Integration test setup for external API interactions

### 7. Code Quality

- Strengthen TypeScript typing with custom types for verification results
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Add JSDoc documentation for complex methods
- Consistent naming conventions
