## Structural Improvements

The main class `LyricStarterService` has grown too large and handles multiple responsibilities. I'd recommend breaking it down into:

1. __A main orchestrator class__ - coordinates the process
2. __Specialized context gatherers__ for each API service
3. __A lyric generator strategy__ - handles AI generation logic
4. __Configuration management__ - externalizes hardcoded values

## Specific Issues and Solutions

### 1. __Performance Optimizations__

- __Issue__: Multiple API calls happen on every request despite context being reusable
- __Solution__: Implement caching layer (Redis/memory cache) for API responses
- __Issue__: Some seed word generation is inefficient with repetitive calculations
- __Solution__: Pre-compute and cache genre-specific seed data

### 2. __Type Safety & Error Handling__

- __Issue__: Several `any` types (e.g., context objects, API responses)
- __Solution__: Define proper TypeScript interfaces and enums
- __Issue__: Error handling could be more granular
- __Solution__: Implement custom error types and better fallbacks

### 3. __Code Organization__

- __Issue__: Large private methods with complex logic
- __Solution__: Break down into smaller, focused methods with single responsibilities
- __Issue__: Duplicate logic between context fetching methods
- __Solution__: Create reusable base context fetcher pattern

### 4. __Configuration Management__

- __Issue__: Hardcoded values scattered throughout (API timeouts, word limits, temperature settings)
- __Solution__: Move to external configuration with environment variable fallbacks

### 5. __Testing & Maintainability__

- __Issue__: Class is difficult to unit test due to tight coupling
- __Solution__: Implement dependency injection and interface-based design
- __Issue__: No obvious logging levels or structured logging
- __Solution__: Add proper log levels and structured logging

### 6. __API Integration Issues__

- __Issue__: Rate limiting and retry logic could be more robust
- __Solution__: Implement circuit breaker pattern for API failures
- __Issue__: Some API calls might fail silently
- __Solution__: Better failure handling with fallback strategies
