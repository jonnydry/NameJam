Below are concrete, **code-level** improvements you can make to the NAME_JAM app itself—not the repo housekeeping.  I’ve kept them small enough that you can knock most of them out in an evening or two.

────────────────────────────────────────
1. **Stop double-checking the same name**
   • Cache web-search results for 24 h (Redis, Upstash, or just an in-memory LRU if you stay on Replit).  
   • Key by lower-cased, trimmed name; 99 % of repeat traffic is people regenerating until they see something they like.

2. **Add a “lock” toggle on any name**  
   • One click adds the name to a local-storage “shortlist”.  
   • Shortlist survives page refresh and can be exported as JSON or copied to clipboard.

3. **Make the search status obvious (UX)**  
   • Replace the generic spinner with a three-state badge:  
     ✅ “Looks available” / ⚠️ “In use on Spotify/IG/etc.” / ❌ “Blocked by trademark”.  
   • Color-blind safe palette: green #22c55e, amber #f59e0b, red #ef4444.

4. **Debounce the “Generate” button**  
   • 350 ms debounce on rapid clicks prevents 5–6 identical calls in <1 s.

5. **Return **why** a name was suggested**  
   • Add a micro-tooltip on hover: “Derived from ‘space + lizard’ because you picked Sci-Fi + Animals”.

6. **Responsive grid for the name cards**  
   • `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-4` is one line of Tailwind and instantly looks better on desktop.

7. **Keyboard shortcuts**  
   • `Space` = generate new batch, `S` = save highlighted card.  Add tiny `kbd` hints under the button.

8. **Plausible deniability for duplicates**  
   • Append a two-digit random hex if the exact name exists on Spotify (“Neon Tigers” → “Neon Tigers 7f”).  
   • Makes it trivial for the user to claim “close enough”.

9. **Server: rate-limit the web-search endpoint**  
   • 30 req / IP / minute is generous but stops abuse.  
   • Use `express-rate-limit` or Replit’s built-in analytics to get IP.

10. **Progressive Web-App shell**  
    • Add a minimal `manifest.json` + service worker that caches the last 50 generated names offline.  
    • Users can “install” the page on Android/iOS and still browse their shortlist with no connection.

11. **A/B test two generation prompts**  
    • Keep the current prompt as “A”;  add a second prompt that is more literal (“Combine these two words: {genre} {animal}”).  
    • Track click-to-copy rate in the front-end;  promote the winner after 1 k impressions.

12. **Accessibility quick wins**  
    • Add `aria-live="polite"` to the result container so screen readers announce new names.  
    • Ensure every button has `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2`.

Pick any three of these and ship them—you’ll get an immediate bump in perceived polish and user retention.
