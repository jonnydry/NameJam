# NameJam - Band & Song Name Generator

## Overview
NameJam is a web application designed to generate unique band names and song titles with real-time availability verification. It combines creative name generation with web-powered checking to help musicians and artists find memorable names for their projects. The project aims to provide a tool that not only sparks creativity but also ensures the practical usability of generated names by integrating with music databases.

  - Created ContextAggregatorService that collects and enriches context from Spotify, Last.fm, ConceptNet, Datamuse, and PoetryDB in parallel
  - All 4 generated names now use AI with comprehensive API context for consistency and quality
  - Enriched context includes: real artist/track names, genre tags, semantic associations, related words, rhymes, adjectives, and poetic vocabulary
  - Context quality assessment (rich/moderate/basic) ensures high-quality generation
  - Removed separate Datamuse generation path - all names now benefit from unified AI approach
  - Improved response speed by parallelizing API context collection
  - Enhanced AI prompts to utilize full context including genre characteristics, mood descriptors, musical terms, and cultural references
  - Fallback mechanism retained for when AI is unavailable
- **PoetryDB Integration**: Added PoetryDB API integration to enhance lyric and name generation with classical poetry context
  - Created PoetryDbService that fetches poetic vocabulary, imagery, and themes based on genre/mood
  - Integrated poetry context into lyric generation to enrich AI prompts with classical poetry elements
  - Added poetry vocabulary to both AI and non-AI name generation for more literary and sophisticated results
  - Poetry context is cached for 15 minutes for optimal performance
  - Maps genres and moods to appropriate poetry search terms (e.g., jazz → moon/night/smoke, metal → darkness/rage)
- **Enhanced 4+ Word Generation with Poetic Flow**: Implemented natural language patterns for names with 4 or more words
  - Created PoeticFlowPatterns class to generate naturally flowing phrases using linguistic templates
  - Integrated all API contexts (Spotify, Last.fm, ConceptNet, Datamuse, PoetryDB) into 4+ word generation

  - Prevented double suffixes and enhanced word quality filters

## Recent Updates (January 2025)
- Implemented comprehensive 5-step API synergy enhancement plan:
  - **Step 1**: AI improvements with dynamic temperature (1.0-1.4), model rotation (grok-2-1212, grok-2-vision-1212, grok-3-mini), forbidden word filtering (30+ overused terms)
  - **Step 2**: Datamuse optimization with multi-query strategy, frequency filtering, contextual chains, enhanced relationship mining
  - **Step 3**: Quality control upgrades including semantic coherence checks, pronunciation validation, anti-repetition system, poetic quality assessment

### Performance Optimizations (January 2025)
- **Parallelized AI Generation**: Changed from sequential to parallel AI name generation, significantly reducing generation time
- **Optimized Quality Checks**: Made quality checks optional and simplified for performance, removing expensive ConceptNet API calls by default
- **Added Caching**: Implemented caching for ConceptNet API responses with 30-minute timeout
- **Removed Sequential Bottlenecks**: Eliminated sequential processing in verification service, now all verifications run in parallel
- **Timeout Improvements**: Increased request timeout to 50 seconds and improved timeout handling to prevent double responses
- **Non-blocking Database Storage**: Made database storage asynchronous to speed up API responses
- **Reduced Retries**: Limited AI generation retries to 1 attempt per model for faster responses
- **AI Model Optimization**: Implemented single-model approach with 10-second timeout (reduced from multi-model sequential attempts)
- **Response Time Improvements**: Achieved 7-10 second response times (down from 50+ seconds)

### Bug Fixes (January 2025)
- **Fixed Band Bio Display**: Fixed issue where raw JSON was displayed instead of biography text. Added proper parsing to extract biography from nested AI response structures.

- **Context Usage**: Better integration of Spotify/Last.fm context data to guide name generation with real musical examples
- **Reduced Generation Count**: Changed from 8 names to 4 names (2 AI + 2 non-AI) to prioritize quality over quantity and improve response speed
- **Unified Word Filtering**: Implemented coordinated word filtering across AI and non-AI generation to prevent repetition within generations (4 results) and reduce similarity between back-to-back generations. Features time-weighted penalties, stem tracking for word variations, and 30-minute word memory for maximum variety while preserving creativity.
- **Retry Logic for Complete Results**: Added intelligent retry mechanisms that generate additional candidates when word filtering rejects names, ensuring users always receive the full count of 4 results (2 AI + 2 non-AI) while maintaining variety standards.

### Code Quality Improvements (January 2025)
