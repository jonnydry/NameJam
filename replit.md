## Key Components

### Name Generation Service
- **Location**: `server/services/nameGenerator.ts`
- **Purpose**: Generates creative band and song names using advanced grammatical patterns with enhanced humor and wordplay
- **Strategy**: Uses multiple generation patterns including grammatical structures, poetic repetition, atmospheric combinations, and narrative flows
- **Customization**: Supports precise word counts (1-3 words) and dynamic "4+" option for poetic narratives (4-7 words), generation types (band/song), and thematic mood selection
- **Advanced Logic**: For 4+ word combinations, employs varied grammatical patterns to create more natural and poetic results
- **Pattern Types**: Article-adjective-noun structures, parallel constructions, repetitive patterns, atmospheric combinations, and narrative sequences
- **Mood Themes**: 12 different mood options (dark, bright, mysterious, energetic, melancholy, ethereal, aggressive, peaceful, nostalgic, futuristic, romantic, epic) that filter word choices to match the desired emotional tone using focused filtering (70% mood-specific words, 30% base vocabulary)
- **Enhanced Humor**: Specialized patterns for 3-5 word combinations featuring wordplay, contradictions, questions, temporal paradoxes, and absurd scenarios
- **Expanded Vocabulary**: Includes humorous and unexpected words (bananas, ninjas, kazoos, etc.) to create more entertaining and surprising results
- **Statement Flow**: 4-6 word names use connecting words ("of", "into", "before", "through", "beyond") to create flowing, statement-like names rather than abstract combinations
- **Advanced Linguistic Features**:
  - **Single Word Names**: Creates compounds (ultrafire), portmanteaus (blending words), and modified words with suffixes
  - **Two Word Names**: Uses semantic pairing (fire/smoke), alliteration (silver shadow), contrasting pairs (frozen fire), and musical term combinations
  - **Three Word Names**: Enhanced with alliterative patterns, emotional journeys, number-based quirks, and expanded contradiction pairs
  - **Contextual Connectors**: Smart connector selection based on spatial, temporal, causal, comparative, or possessive relationships
  - **Smart Capitalization**: Applies proper title case rules, keeping small words lowercase unless they start the name


### Set List Generator Service
- **Location**: `/api/generate-setlist` endpoint using existing name generation service
- **Purpose**: Creates organized song lists for musical performances with professional set structure
- **Options**: 8-song or 16-song set lists with mood and genre settings
- **Structure**: Automatically splits songs into two sets plus a finale (8-song: 3+4+1, 16-song: 7+8+1)
- **Word Variation**: Automatically uses varied word counts (1-6 words) with weighted distribution favoring 2-4 word songs
- **Integration**: Uses identical name generation algorithms as main generator with full quality parameters
- **Verification**: Each song includes comprehensive Spotify API verification with detailed availability status
- **Features**: Real-time Spotify database checking, stash integration, and XAI-powered band name generation

### AI Name Generation Service
- **Location**: `server/services/aiNameGenerator.ts` with `/api/generate-ai-name` endpoint

  - **Rhyme Words**: Common rhyme patterns for lyrical flow
  - **Sensory Words**: Vivid imagery vocabulary for poetic expression
- **JSON Prompt Structure**: Uses reliable JSON-based prompts with Datamuse context for consistent results
- **Implementation**: Fetches context words from Datamuse → Structures into JSON → AI generates lyrics using enriched vocabulary
- **Benefits**: More authentic, genre-appropriate lyrics with richer vocabulary than pure AI generation

### Name Verification Service
- **Location**: `server/services/nameVerifier.ts`
- **Purpose**: Provides real name availability checking against music databases with Spotify as the top priority
- **Verification Priority Order**:
  1. **Spotify Web API** - Primary and first verification source for authoritative music database searches
  2. **Spotify Similar Matches** - Secondary check for close matches on Spotify
  3. **Famous Names Database** - 50+ well-known bands and songs for backup detection
  4. **Other APIs** - Last.fm and MusicBrainz as fallback sources
- **Enhanced Results**: Returns detailed availability status with popularity scores, genres, and album information from Spotify
- **Differentiated Logic**: Stricter verification for bands (unique names required) vs more lenient for songs (shared titles allowed)
- **Verification Links**: Includes direct Spotify search links for manual verification

### ConceptNet Integration Service
- **Location**: `server/services/conceptNetService.ts`
- **Purpose**: Enhances name generation with semantic knowledge and conceptual associations
