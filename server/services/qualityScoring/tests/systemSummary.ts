  title: "Enhanced Quality Metrics System for Music Name Generation",
  
  overview: `
    A comprehensive quality assessment framework that combines phonetic analysis with semantic meaning
    to provide multi-dimensional quality scoring for music band names and song titles. The system
    integrates advanced linguistic analysis, cultural context, emotional resonance, and genre-specific
    optimization to generate names with measurably superior quality.
